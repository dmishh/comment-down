## comment-down package

###Moves cursor down one line after toggling comment

This allows you to click on a line and then hit comment-toggle repeatedly to comment multiple lines.

Install as you would any other package.  This new behavior will then always be there until you disable or uninstall this package.

There are no settings, commands, or menu items.
